# SmartMeterSmartRecepticle
This is Team 5G's 2016 Code Jam Submission for the Smart City Smart Country theme. 
This project allows for the tracking of power consumption per outlet in a home. 
This project is 4 part, there is the Smart Receptacle, Smart Meter, Android Application for the home ownerâ€™s system and a Website for the electricity commission.
It also allows for a user to remotely turn on or turn off an outlet using the Android Application. 
The Android application also allows for the viewing of the data collected by the smart meter and viewing stats and trends in power consumption and even a bill estimate. 
The Website allows for the electricity commission to see power consumption data of all of the smart meters connected to them and they can even export the data for further analysis.
